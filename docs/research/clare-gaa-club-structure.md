## Key Statistics

- **Total clubs in Clare:** 53
- **Dual clubs (offering both hurling and football):** 8
- **Players seeking inter-club transfers (2025):** ~928
  - Adult level: 428
  - Underage grades: ~500

## Dual Clubs in Clare

Only 8 of Clare's 53 clubs operate as dual organizations offering both hurling and football:

1. Clooney-Quin
2. Corofin
3. Cratloe
4. Éire Óg Ennis
5. St Joseph's Doora-Barefield
6. The Banner
7. Wolfe Tones
8. Parteen Meelick GAA

## Structural Issues

Clare County Board chairman Kieran Keating noted that Clare is "unique in the number of players given permission annually to play either football or hurling with a club other than their home club." This represents a structural weakness in the county's GAA organization.

Many inter-county representatives must travel significant distances (22-28 km) between their football and hurling club affiliations.

## Implications for Database

This confirms Clare has approximately 53 clubs. Our database currently has 54 regular clubs, which is very close to this official figure. The slight discrepancy may be due to:

- Combined/amalgamated clubs counted differently
- Recent club formations or dissolutions
- Parteen and Meelick potentially being counted as one combined entity
