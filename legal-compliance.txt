Legal Compliance
Gaelic Trips Ltd operates with full awareness and respect for the legal frameworks that govern travel services and consumer protection across Europe. Below is a summary of our legal obligations and compliance position regarding the current version of our platform.

1. Legal Status of Gaelic Trips Products
Our core offerings—Team Tickets and Day Passes—are classified as Linked Travel Arrangements (LTAs) under Directive (EU) 2015/2302. They do not meet the criteria of a "package holiday" because they exclude accommodation, flights, or transport. This ensures reduced regulatory burden while still providing protections to consumers in case of insolvency by the primary service provider.

We avoid packaging multiple services together in a single price or transaction unless verified to remain within LTA definitions .

2. EU Legal Compliance
Directive (EU) 2015/2302 on Package Travel and Linked Travel Arrangements:

Gaelic Trips ensures that customers are clearly informed when they are booking an LTA, not a package.

Required standardised pre-contractual information is provided to all travellers.

Insolvency protection is in place where applicable, as per the directive.

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):

Gaelic Trips collects only the minimum necessary data.

All user data is handled in accordance with GDPR, with secure processing and storage using Stripe and Wix Velo infrastructure.

Consumer Rights Directive (2011/83/EU):

Gaelic Trips provides transparent pricing, clear cancellation terms, and customer service channels compliant with EU consumer standards.

3. Irish Law Compliance
As a company registered in Ireland:

Gaelic Trips complies with the Consumer Protection Act 2007, including fair marketing and advertising standards.

The platform operates under the Electronic Commerce Act 2000, ensuring valid electronic contracts and secure payment processing.

Our terms and conditions, cancellation rights, and refund policies meet the requirements of Irish contract and consumer law.

4. Platform Terms & Conditions
All transactions processed through the Gaelic Trips platform:

Are governed by a written agreement (available in full at checkout).

Include terms regarding cancellation, payment, refunds, and dispute resolution.

Require user acknowledgment of the product classification (LTA vs. package) before purchase.

5. Liability and Risk Management
Organisers (clubs) are responsible for delivering the services outlined in the Day Pass description.

Gaelic Trips Ltd provides the booking infrastructure and retains a portion of platform fees for administrative and legal coverage.

In the event of disputes or underperformance, Gaelic Trips reserves the right to withhold club payouts pending resolution.

Transparency, Always
Our pricing model is deliberately minimal: Gaelic Trips earns less than the price of a pint per player. But behind the scenes, we operate with professional-grade systems and legal diligence to support clubs and travellers across Europe.
